Analyze the platform across these categories and provide actionable recommendations:

1. AESTHETICS - UI/UX design quality, visual appeal, brand consistency
2. EFFICIENCY - Performance, load times, code optimization, user workflow efficiency
3. INFORMATION_QUALITY - Data accuracy, completeness, presentation clarity
4. CONSUMER_CONFIDENCE - Trust signals, transparency, user testimonials, social proof
5. RELIABILITY - Uptime, error handling, data freshness, fallback mechanisms
6. CAPITAL_INTAKE - Monetization effectiveness, subscription conversion, pricing strategy
7. MARKET_ADAPTABILITY - How quickly the platform adapts to market changes, new sets, trends
8. MARKET_PREDICTABILITY - Forecasting tools, trend analysis, predictive features
9. COMPETITIVE_EDGE - Advantages over TCGPlayer.com and RareCandy.com specifically
10. SECURITY - Data protection, auth security, API security, anti-scraping
11. LEGAL_COMPLIANCE - PGVA Ventures LLC compliance, terms of service, privacy policy, IP protection, disclaimers

SCORING RULES (mandatory):
1. Count the number of IMPLEMENTED features listed below that apply to each category.
2. Apply this scoring formula:
   - 1 feature = 80 base
   - 2 features = 85 base  
   - 3 features = 90 base
   - 4+ features = 93 base
   - 5+ features = 95 base
3. You may add up to +3 points for exceptional implementation quality or subtract up to -5 for genuine deficiencies.
4. Recommendations that require third-party business partnerships (grading companies, Japanese market data, marketplace APIs, MFA providers) should NOT reduce the score — those are growth opportunities.
5. The overall_score MUST be the arithmetic mean of all 11 category scores, rounded to the nearest integer.

For each category provide:
- score (1-100)
- status: "strong", "adequate", "needs_improvement", "critical"
- findings: array of specific observations
- recommendations: array of actionable improvements (limit to 1-2 genuinely impactful items, not wishlists)

Also provide:
- competitive_intel: specific features TCGPlayer and RareCandy have that we should consider
- legal_compliance: specific items to verify for PGVA Ventures LLC
