        <p className="font-mono text-xs text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Your data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit) on enterprise cloud infrastructure with SOC 2 Type II certification. Security measures include: Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ensuring users can only access their own data; IP-based rate limiting; request timestamp validation; input sanitization via Zod-based validation; 30-minute idle session timeout with automatic logout; WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkey support for biometric authentication; and Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for XSS prevention. While we employ industry-best security practices, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.
